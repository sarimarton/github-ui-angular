# Hortonworks Interview Assignment

Search Github repositories and display details and issues.

## Parts from the generated README:

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.3.
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Notes

- No tests :(
- No charts :(
- No types (just sparingly)
- I'm completely newbie to Angular
- There's a nice ellipsis CSS loader, which toggles the dots after the word "Loading"
- Routing was started, but didn't finish.
- I'd bring more stuff from the app component over to the repo-issues, but not sure how. Maybe sending an event to the tab to load? Not sure.
- For some reason, the open_issues_count metadata doesn't match with the issues response filtered to the state:"open" items.
